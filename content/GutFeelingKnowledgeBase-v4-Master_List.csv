It is a facultatively anaerobic chemoorganotroph capable of both respiratory and fermentative metabolism. E.coli serves a useful function in the body by suppressing the growth of harmful bacterial species and by synthesising appreciable amounts of vitamins. It is an important component of the biosphere. It colonizes the lower gut of animals and survives when released to the natural environment, allowing widespread dissemination to new hosts. Pathogenic E.coli strains are responsible for infection of the enteric, urinary, pulmonary and nervous systems. Uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli (UPEC) are the most common cause of non-hospital-acquired urinary tract infections, responsible for 70-90% of the 7 million cases of acute cystitis and 250,000 cases of pyelonephritis reported annually in the United States. Strain O6:H1:K? belongs to phylogroup B2. It was isolated at the University of Maryland Hospital. [UP000001410]","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common human infections and are a frequent cause of antibiotic therapy. In view of increasing resistance rates against antibiotics, treatment failures become an important issue. In the search for new approaches to treating these infections, the complex interactions of bacterial virulence factors with their host targets need to be deciphered. Bacterial virulence factors are crucial for adherence to host cells, improvement of nutrition of the pathogen, mediation of motility, and manipulation of the inflammatory response of the host. In the case of UTIs, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains are the predominant cause. They are equipped with a variety of virulence factors including fimbrial adhesins, toxins, invasins, autotransporter proteins, iron-acquisition systems, and flagella (2̐4), together enabling the bacteria to attack host tissues and successfully establish the infection. uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains, such as CFT073, express Toll/IL-1 receptor̐containing (TIR-containing) protein C (TcpC), which impairs TLR signaling, thereby suppressing innate immunity in the urinary tract and enhancing persistence in the kidneys.

They were first isolated and described over one hundred years ago from human feces and were quickly associated with a healthy gastrointestinal tract (GIT) due to their numerical dominance in breast fed infants compared to bottle fed infants. In the neonate their numerical advantage confers a substantial health benefit by hindering pathogen colonization through competitive exclusion. It is important for establishing and maintaining homeostasis of the intestinal ecosystem to allow for normal digestion. B. longum is characterized by a unique hexose metabolism that occurs via a phosphoketolase pathway often termed the bifid shunt. Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) is a key enzyme of the bifid shunt and its presence is the most common diagnostic test for this genus, as it is not present in other Gram-positive intestinal bacteria. B. longum is often the dominant species detected in humans and is the only species to regularly harbor plasmids. It is a leading member of the probiotic bacteria due to numerous studies that have provided a growing body of evidence for its role in a myriad of potential health benefits. These include diarrhea prevention in antibiotic treated patients, cholesterol reduction, alleviation of lactose intolerance symptoms, immune stimulation and cancer prevention. The stabilizing effect on GIT microflora is attributed to the capacity of bifidobacterium to produce bacteriocins, which are bacteriostatic agents with a broad spectrum of action, and to their pH-reducing activity. Selection of suitable strains for probiotic purposes is very difficult as inherent characteristics of strains of B. longum that are necessary for its survival and competition in the human large intestine are currently very poorly understood. The use of the sequenced genome in microarray analysis reveals pertinent traits that are important to attain dominance in these complex ecosystems. [UP000000439]","The ability of Bifidobacterium spp. to survive and persist in this competitive environment is made possible by use of negative transcriptional regulation as a flexible control mechanism in response to nutrient availability and diversity as well as predicted genetic features such as exo- and endo-glycosyl hydrolases and high affinity oligosaccharide transporters. These features likely help B. longum compete for uptake of structurally diverse oligosaccharides released from digestion of plant fibers. Several studies conducted on fructose-containing polymers as potential selective substrates for colonic bacteria have provided evidence that bifidobacteria are able to ferment these carbohydrates, particularly the short chains of β-2→1-linked fructosyl units. Recently bifidobacteria were shown to possess only one pathway for the metabolism of glucose, the F6P phosphoketolase (F6PPK) pathway, otherwise known as the bifid shunt. Analyses of fructose fermentation patterns suggested that B. longum could use d-fructose as the sole carbon source; however, the uptake mechanism of fructose into the cell and proteins regulated by fructose remained to be defined.

They were first isolated and described over one hundred years ago from human feces and were quickly associated with a healthy gastrointestinal tract (GIT) due to their numerical dominance in breast fed infants compared to bottle fed infants. It is important for establishing and maintaining homeostasis of the intestinal ecosystem to allow for normal digestion. B. longum is characterized by a unique hexose metabolism that occurs via a phosphoketolase pathway often termed the bifid shunt. Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) is a key enzyme of the bifid shunt and its presence is the most common diagnostic test for this genus, as it is not present in other Gram-positive intestinal bacteria. B. longum is often the dominant species detected in humans and is the only species to regularly harbor plasmids. It is a leading member of the probiotic bacteria due to numerous studies that have provided a growing body of evidence for its role in a myriad of potential health benefits. These include diarrhea prevention in antibiotic treated patients, cholesterol reduction, alleviation of lactose intolerance symptoms, immune stimulation and cancer prevention. The stabilizing effect on GIT microflora is attributed to the capacity of bifidobacterium to produce bacteriocins, which are bacteriostatic agents with a broad spectrum of action, and to their pH-reducing activity. Selection of suitable strains for probiotic purposes is very difficult as inherent characteristics of strains of B. longum that are necessary for its survival and competition in the human large intestine are currently very poorly understood. The use of the sequenced genome in microarray analysis reveals pertinent traits that are important to attain dominance in these complex ecosystems. In Bifidobacterium longum (strain DJO10A), the deletion of genomic regions, often facilitated by mobile elements, allows to adapt to fermentation environments in a very rapid manner (2 genome deletions per 1,000 generations) and the concomitant loss of possible competitive abilities in the gut.

In the gut, M. smithii converts H2, CO2, and formate into CH4 using carbon as the terminal electron acceptor; this redox reaction sustains anaerobic respiration, which allows for the production of ATP.

Streptococcus suis is a major porcine pathogen in many countries. It causes serious zoonotic diseases (diseases which can be transmitted naturally between animals and humans) such as meningitis, septicaemia, endocarditis, arthritis, and septic shock in both pigs and human beings, and mortality is high. There are 35 serotypes of S.suis, of which serotype SS2 is the most prevalent. Two recent large-scale outbreaks of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) in China were caused by SS2 (in 1998 and 2005). Human infection is almost always associated with exposure to pigs or their food products. Infection is rare in Europe and N. America, while infections rates with S. suis are greater in S.E. Asia and China. Meningitis is the most common presentation in humans, but septicemia and endocarditis are also seen. Highly pathogenic strain ST1 (sequence type 1) GZ1 was isolated in 2005 from a patient in Guizhou Province, China who had septicemia. Based on comparison of different genomes it is suggested that strain GZ1 evolved from an intermediately pathogenic S.suis (such as ST25 89/1591) and has since undergone further evolution to become the epidemic strain ST7 SC84 (STRSX) (adapted from PMID 19016627).

These factors include the capsular polysaccharide (CPS), muramidase-release protein (Mrp), extracellular factor (EF) and suilysin. CPS is the only proven critical virulence factor of S. suis. Unencapsulated isogenic mutants were shown to be avirulent in pig and mouse models of infection. CPS facilitates the survival of the organism in the bloodstream. The sialic acid component located in the terminal position of CPS is likely to be responsible for the antiphagocytosis. Despite the lack of evidence that Mrp, EF and suilysin play a critical role in virulence, a positive association was observed between the presence of these factors and virulence in European and Asian strains. In addition, suilysin appears to be toxic to not only epithelial and endothelial cells but also monocytes and neutrophils, suggesting a role in the immune evasion of the host. [PMID: 21479213]",

They were first isolated and described over one hundred years ago from human feces and were quickly associated with a healthy gastrointestinal tract (GIT) due to their numerical dominance in breast fed infants compared to bottle fed infants. In the neonate their numerical advantage confers a substantial health benefit by hindering pathogen colonization through competitive exclusion. It is important for establishing and maintaining homeostasis of the intestinal ecosystem to allow for normal digestion. B. longum is characterized by a unique hexose metabolism that occurs via a phosphoketolase pathway often termed the bifid shunt. Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) is a key enzyme of the bifid shunt and its presence is the most common diagnostic test for this genus, as it is not present in other Gram-positive intestinal bacteria. B. longum is often the dominant species detected in humans and is the only species to regularly harbor plasmids. It is a leading member of the probiotic bacteria due to numerous studies that have provided a growing body of evidence for its role in a myriad of potential health benefits. These include diarrhea prevention in antibiotic treated patients, cholesterol reduction, alleviation of lactose intolerance symptoms, immune stimulation and cancer prevention. The stabilizing effect on GIT microflora is attributed to the capacity of bifidobacterium to produce bacteriocins, which are bacteriostatic agents with a broad spectrum of action, and to their pH-reducing activity. Selection of suitable strains for probiotic purposes is very difficult as inherent characteristics of strains of B. longum that are necessary for its survival and competition in the human large intestine are currently very poorly understood.

It is a facultatively anaerobic chemoorganotroph capable of both respiratory and fermentative metabolism. E.coli serves a useful function in the body by suppressing the growth of harmful bacterial species and by synthesising appreciable amounts of vitamins. It is an important component of the biosphere. It colonizes the lower gut of animals and survives when released to the natural environment, allowing widespread dissemination to new hosts. Pathogenic E.coli strains are responsible for infection of the enteric, urinary, pulmonary and nervous systems. Comparison of 20 E.coli/Shigella strains shows the core genome to be about 2000 genes while the pan-genome has over 18,000 genes. There are multiple, striking integration hotspots that are conserved across the genomes, corresponding to regions of abundant and parallel insertions and deletions of genetic material. Escherichia coli O78:H11:K80 strain H10407, phylogroup A, is an enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolate, ETEC being the leading cause of human diarrhea worldwide, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths among children under 5 each year. Strain H10407 was isolated from an adult with cholera-like symptoms in Dacca, Bangladesh before 1973, and has been shown to cause diarrhea in adult volunteers. Data presented here and previously indicate that the chromosome of H10407 is most closely related to those of nonpathogenic E.coli strains and that the virulence factors associated with ETEC are found on the plasmids. Comparison of the plasmid contents of various ETEC strain suggests that there is core of plasmid-encoded genes that are predicted to be involved in virulence and that may be essential for ETEC. Thus H10407 was probably a commensal strain that acquired plasmid-encoded toxin genes, a fimbrial system and a novel type I secretion system and therefore became virulent (adapted from PMID 20802035). Plasmid p666 has been previously sequenced (INSDC accession number AP010910, PMID 19767599), it is also known as pEntH10407.

As a member of the Bacteroidetesphylum, Bacteroides spp. diverged from the common line of eubacterial descent before the major eubacterial groups and are distinct from the other major Gram-negative phylum, the Proteobacteria. Their membranes contain sphingolipids, and the structure of their promoters and ribosomal binding sites is distinct from that of proteobacteria.
